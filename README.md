# Week11
  This is a simple project that allows you to create and modify a project in a small project database. 
  It utilizes MySQL and Java 17, both of which may be required to replicate it. 
  I used MySQL, Eclipse, and DBeaver to create it. 
  Feel free to use it as you wish, as this is just a student assignment for my online coding course.
